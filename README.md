## Project Description

- ### Background:

  This project is a part of General Assembly's SEIF (Software Engineering Immersive Flex) Bootcamp course with following requirement:

  - Project Goal: Create a web app with React and everything we had learned so far (HTML, CSS, Javascript). It should read APIs data too.
  - Duration: 2 weeks. <br> <br>

- ### Why this project?

  E-commerce websites are typically packed with many practical features. Choosing this as starting point allows me to learn while creating these features, meanwhile exposes me to some practical problems that developer would face when codes expands.

  In addition, taking this project as an opportunity I try to apply all the coding best practises(e.g. DRY, modularity, maintanable etc.) that I had learned so far.<br> <br>

- ### How it works?

  Since the scope of this project is to create practical features of e-commerce website, most of the features here shall appear and function inituitively. With that in mind, only the features created in this project would be mentioned here.

  This is the simplified version of block diagram. Component that appears on different pages are reused and behave the same.
